# agiwithpi
AGIwithPi is an experimental hybrid AI assistant built with Python, combining SQLite for structured data and Chroma (a vector database) for semantic search. By merging short-term and long-term memory, it provides context-aware interactions and self-updating capabilitiesâ€”an early step toward more advanced, AGI-like behavior.
